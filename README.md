Hello everyone, this is my first project with the Boostrap framework in which I integrate HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It's basic, I only had 2 days to do it. 
Use already compiled CSS and JS to get the job done faster.
I hope you see it and comment on it, correct it and teach me good practices. Thank you so much!
